Counts the amount of incident occurences that fall within the configured window. If it is reduced to 0, it autocloses the incident.

There is a tradeoff to be made:

- either we select all occurrence logs regardless of window in a single select, this improves database performance in case of many open incidents, however it may become less then ideal if you ever have a very long running incident
- we select occurrence logs for each incident according to its window, this will be slower in case of many open incidents but faster in case of long running incidents

In case of low occurrence rates in general it doesn't matter which strategy, in case of high occurrence rates, the chance is likely that we have a few incidents with a lot of logs. So currently we opt for the first approach until we know more about how this will play out.
